# Better Rolls for 5e - A FoundryVTT Module
A module for modifying certain sheet functions on Foundry VTT Character sheets for DnD5e. It allows for quick, compounded rolls for items, ability checks saving throws, and just about any roll you might want in 5th Edition DnD.

Though initially a fork of Hooking's [Item Sheet Buttons](https://gitlab.com/hooking/foundry-vtt---item-sheet-buttons) module, it now includes several roll templates designed for Foundry's 5e sheets to increase speed of play.

Felix's [Chat Damage Buttons](https://github.com/syl3r86/chatdamagebuttons-betterrolls) module has been implemented into core Better Rolls.

## Implemented Features
- Custom d20 roll modes for Single, Dual, and Triple rolls. Single mode will roll double in the case of advantage and disadvantage.
- Rolls with advantage or disadvantage highlight the correct roll, indicating which roll is used.
- Improved roll outputs into chat for efficiency. Pretentiously dubbed "Better Rolls", these compounded rolls can include dual d20 rolls for attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws, but also damage rolls and automatic critical damage calculation.

- Added sheet buttons when expanding an item's summary in the sheet, allowing the sheet to quickly output whatever is needed (Attack & damage rolls combined, attack & alternate damage, just attack, just damage...)

- Clicking an item/feat/spell's icon will give a quick roll, based on the fields present in the item clicked.

Clicking with/without the Alt key:

- Alt Quick Rolls, which can be used by holding Alt when clicking the item's icon in the character sheet. These can be configured separately from normal Quick Rolls.

- Need for clicking through prompts in order to get a single roll is removed, allowing for ease of use.
- Per-item options for showing the item's description on a quick roll.
- Per-item critical threshold.
- Supports dnd5e's additional damage rolls, which are fully configurable for appearing on Quick Rolls!

- Natively supports the Better NPC Sheet

- Configurable options for disabling better rolls, changing sheet outputs, and labels for both roll sets and damage type.

- Localization support - now comes with full Japanese and Korean translations!

- Macro support! Try dragging and dropping an item, spell, or feat from your character sheet onto the macro hotbar!
- Script macros are also intuitive enough to be entered manually.
- Try `BetterRolls.quickRoll("Shortbow");` on a creature with an item named "Shortbow", or `BetterRolls.quickRollByName("Sharon", "Shortbow");` to fire Sharon's shortbow.

- Custom damage labels. Add written context to damage rolls to convey what the damage comes from, or when it occurs.

## Planned Features
- Additional macro support

## Known Issues
- None which are major.

## Implementation
Custom sheet creators can register their sheet with Better Rolls 5e using the hooks added to `window` by listening for the `betterRollsAddedToWindow` hook. See the [hooks](betterrolls5e/scripts/hooks.js) file for what is available on the window.

```js
Hooks.once('betterRollsAddedToWindow', function () {
  if (window.BetterRolls) {
    window.BetterRolls.hooks.addActorSheet('OGL5eCharacterSheet');
  }
});
```
